# coxpresdbr 0.0.0.9000

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

- Added functions for importing CoxpresDB datasets from an existing archive.
  The functions work without having to decompress/recompress the archive. 
  The user must have `tar`, `grep` and `bzip2` installed on a unix-alike
  system.
